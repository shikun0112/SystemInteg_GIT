## Usage
You can interact with the API by making HTTP requests using any 
HTTP client or programming language capable of sending HTTP requests. 
Below are examples of cURL commands for each endpoint:

1. Create a New Name Entry
    *To create a new name entry in the database, you can use the following cURL command:
    
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "fname": "John",
    "lname": "Doe"
    }' http://your-api-url/postName

    *Replace http://your-api-url with the actual URL where your API is hosted.

2. Retrieve and Print Names
    *To retrieve and print names from the database, you can use the following cURL command:

    curl -X GET http://your-api-url/printName

    *Replace http://your-api-url with the actual URL where your API is hosted.

3. Update a Name Entry
    *To update a name entry in the database, you can use the following cURL command. Replace {id} with the actual ID of the name entry you want to update:

    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "fname": "Updated First Name",
    "lname": "Updated Last Name"
    }' http://your-api-url/updateName/{id}

    *Replace http://your-api-url with the actual URL where your API is hosted and {id} with the ID of the name entry.

4. Delete a Name Entry
    *To delete a name entry from the database, you can use the following cURL command. Replace {id} with the actual ID of the name entry you want to delete:

    curl -X DELETE http://your-api-url/deleteName/{id}

    *Replace http://your-api-url with the actual URL where your API is hosted and {id} with the ID of the name entry you want to delete.

    *Feel free to use any HTTP client or programming language of your choice to interact with the API as per your requirements.

    *It is required also to customize the placeholders like 
    `http://your-api-url` and `{id}` with the actual values as needed.
